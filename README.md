# BMI Calculator Using React
A BMI Calculator application using the ReactJS framework. A BMI calculator finds the relation between height and weight of a person. It gives a numerical value based on which the individual is categorised into underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese. 

The formula to calculate BMI is: 
```
BMI = Weight(kg)/(Height(m))^2
```

The category of BMI is as follows:

- **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5
- **Normal Weight:** BMI between 18.5 and 25
- **Overweight:** BMI between 25 and 29.9
- **Obese:** BMI > 30

## Technologies Used/Pre-requisites:

- ReactJS
- CSS
- JSX
- Function Components in React

## Approach:

This application is basically developed through functional components and also manages the state accordingly. The application takes input from the end user like height in cms, weight in kgs and calculates the BMI score, and also gives the message to the user whether he/she is underweight, normal, or obese. The logic of this calculation and giving the message is implemented using JSX. It takes height and weight as the input and calculates the BMI score and gives the message about the body language. We have done all the code in the App.js file, which can be easily understandable. A simple approach is been applied to develop this application.
